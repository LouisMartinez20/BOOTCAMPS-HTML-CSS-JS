    <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>

    <li>
      <b>Declarative:</b> React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.
      Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will
      efficiently update and render just the right components when your data
      changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to
      understand, and easier to debug.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Component-Based:</b> Build encapsulated components that manage their
      own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is
      written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data
      through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Learn Once, Write Anywhere:</b> We don't make assumptions about the
      rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React
      without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using
      Node and power mobile apps using
      <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native.</a>

    <h2>installation</h2>
    <p>
      React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and you can
      use as little or as much React as you need:
    </p>

    <li>
      Use
      <a href="https://react.dev/learn#online-playgrounds"

      >

      as a '&lt;script&gt;' tag in one minute
    </li>

        >Create a New React App</a
      >
      if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain
    </li>

    <p>
      You can use React as a '&lt;script&gt;' tag from a
      <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html">CDN</a>, or as a
      react package on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react">npm.</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Documetation</h2>

    <p>
      You can find the React documentation
      <a href="https://react.dev/">on the website. </a><br />
      Check out the <a href="https://react.dev/learn">Getting Started</a> page
      for a quick overview. <br />
      The documentation is divided into several sections: <br />

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>
      We have several examples
      <a href="https://react.dev/">on the website.</a> Here is the first one to
      get you started:
    </p>
    <pre><code>import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return &lt;div&gt;Hello {name}&lt;/div&gt;;
}
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("container"));
root.render(&lt;HelloMessage name="Taylor" /&gt;);</code></pre>

    <p>
      This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.
      <br />
      You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax;
      <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html"
        >we call it JSX.</a
      >
      JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and
      writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a
      '&lt;script&gt;' tag, read
      <a
        href="https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project#optional-try-react-with-jsx"
        >this section</a
      >
      on integrating JSX; otherwise, the
      <a href="https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app"
        >recommended JavaScript toolchains</a
      >
      handle it automatically
    </p>
    <p></p>
