    <h1>React</h1>
    <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>

    <li>
      Declarative:
      <p>
        React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views
        for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update
        and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative
        views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier
        to debug.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own
      state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is
      written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data
      through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
    </li>
    <li>
      Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of
      your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without
      rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node
      and power mobile apps using React Native.
    </li>

    <h2>installation</h2>
    <p>
      React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and you can
      use as little or as much React as you need:
    </p>

    <li>Use Online Playgrounds to get a taste of React</li>
    <li>Add React to a Website as a '&lt;script&gt;' tag in one minute</li>
    <li>
      Create a New React App if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript
      toolchain
    </li>

    <p>
      You can use React as a '&lt;script&gt;' tag from a CDN, or as a react
      package on npm.
    </p>
    <h2>Documetation</h2>

    <p>
      You can find the React documentation on the website. <br />
      Check out the Getting Started page for a quick overview. <br />
      The documentation is divided into several sections: <br />
    </p>

    <li>Tutorial</li>
    <li>Main Concepts</li>
    <li>Advance Guides</li>
    <li>API Reference</li>
    <li>Where to Get Support</li>
    <li>Contributing Guide</li>

    <p>You can improve it by sending pull requests to this repository.</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>
      We have several examples on the website. Here is the first one to get you
      started:
    </p>
    <pre><code>import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return &lt;div&gt;Hello {name}&lt;/div&gt;;
}
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("container"));
root.render(&lt;HelloMessage name="Taylor" /&gt;);</code></pre>

    <p>
      This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.
      <br />
      You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX. JSX is not
      required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it
      feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a '&lt;script&gt;' tag,
      read this section on integrating JSX; otherwise, the recommended
      JavaScript toolchains handle it automatically
    </p>
    <p></p>
